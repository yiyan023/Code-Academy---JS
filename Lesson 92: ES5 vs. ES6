//ES5 uses var to declare variables
//ES6 uses let, const, etc., to declare variables

//ES5 Example:
var pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

var meat = "Pancetta"; // ES6 syntax

var sauce = "Eggs and cheese"; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6
var carbonara = 'You can make carbonara with' + pasta + ', ' + meat + ', and a sauce made with' + sauce '.';

//ES6 Example:
const pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

const meat = "Pancetta"; // ES6 syntax

let sauce = "Eggs and cheese"; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6
const carbonara = `You can make carbonara with ${pasta}, ${meat}, and a sauce made with ${sauce}.`;
